                    With pressure to deliver affordable financial advice profitably, tackle rising costs and inject value into the advice process, more financial advice practices are looking at ways to automate. It’s one of those things businesses know they should be doing but struggle with because it’s hard to know where to start. Focus on the wrong thing and you could waste time and effort automating work that doesn’t bring you any real benefit.    </p>

                  Since Iress formally acquired OneVue in November last year we’ve been working to bring our two organisations together. The combination of technology from Iress and OneVue’s market-leading platform services and unit registry administration, and superannuationexternal services provides a unique opportunity to deliver end-to-end investment infrastructure, ultimately improving efficiency and transparency for everyone in financial services. The integration of the NMPEducationexternal business further enhances our vision of transparency and efficiency, giving advisers and consumers alike the knowledge they need to make better decisions.
